## The World Transformed privacy policy

This privacy policy outlines the processes The World Transformed follows when storing and handling personal data. The World Transformed is a private limited company by guarantee, company number 10278809.

The data controller is The World Transformed of 29 Glanville Road, London, England, SW2 5DE. The World Transformed can be contacted at that address, on info@theworldtransformed.org.

This policy was updated on 13 June 2018 to document our processes in line with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

### Data types collected

The World Transformed collects names and contact details (such as email and postal addresses and phone numbers) for the purpose of our mailing list, ticketing system and Supporters Network. 

We also store information on whether or not you are a member of our Supporters Network and information on how much, when and how often you have donated.

### Mailing list

All subscribers to our mailing list have explicitly opted in and consented to receive The World Transformedâ€™s email newsletter, which includes updates about our latest projects and events. The GDPR lawful basis for this data processing is consent.

We send emails using email service Mailchimp. Mailchimp's role is limited to providing software to create and send emails, storage of our email list and consent records, and offering list subscribe and unsubscribe facilities. We have entered into a data processing agreement with Mailchimp to this end. 

We will retain this data for as long as you remain subscribed to the list. You can opt out from our email list at any time. Every email includes a link to unsubscribe from the list.

### Tickets

The World Transformed collects special category data with its ticket sales. These sensitive categories of data are ethnic background, disability, political party affiliation and trade union membership. This data is only processed for the purposes of analysing the composition of our audience to help ensure that the festival is accessible to and representative of a wide cross-section of society. We only hold this data long enough to process it into anonymised metadata and do not retain any identifiable sensitive personal data. The GDPR lawful basis for this data processing is consent.

Our ticketing system also collects data on age, gender, and whether or not you are bringing children to the festival. The GDPR lawful basis of this data processing is consent.

The World Transformed will use the contact details of ticket-holders to periodically send them relevant information about the event for which they have tickets, such as accessibility information, the programme timetable, or last minute schedule or venue changes.

### Supporters Network data

When you sign up to join our Supporters Network and pay a monthly donation, The World Transformed will save your contact details for the purposes of sending you our Supporters Newsletter, your free tickets, and information about other special offers and Supporters Network exclusive events.The GDPR lawful basis for this data processing is consent.

The World Transformed will also process this data from time to time with information relevant to your subscription, for example if you wish to cancel your donation or if you notify us of a change of your address.

Your data is stored securely on third-party servers operated by MailChimp, Donorbox and Google.

We will retain this data for as long as you remain a member of our Supporters Network. We delete the data of lapsed subscribers one year after the date their subscription ends. This period is to allow for re-subscription reminder notices. 

### Cookies

This website uses cookies for the purpose of gathering anonymised statistics about page views, using Google Analytics. This does not include any personally identifiable data. You can opt out of Google Analytics at this link: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/>

### Payment data

The World Transformed does not see or store any sensitive payment information such as credit card details. Before we get access to our payments log, card details are removed from it by our payments service providers.

Data necessary to process credit and debit card payments is held by our card payment processor Stripe. 

### International Transfers

We are based in the United Kingdom and primarily collect and process data in the UK.

However, we do use third party processors who process data on our behalf and are based in the United States. The US is one of the territories outside the European Union whose laws are currently not considered to meet the same legal standards of protection for Personal Data as set out under Data Protection Law in Europe.

The US based third parties we use are Mailchimp (who handle supporter emails on our behalf), Donorbox (who handle donations on our behalf), and Stripe (who handle card payments on our behalf). All three are currently certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework which means that they are regarded as meeting the standards for protection of personal data that comply with Data Protection Law.
